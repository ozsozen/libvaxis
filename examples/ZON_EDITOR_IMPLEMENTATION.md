# ZON Editor Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a minimalist terminal-based editor for viewing and editing Zig Object Notation (.zon) files as requested in the issue. The implementation follows the established patterns in the libvaxis examples directory.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **examples/zon_editor.zig** (480 lines)
   - Main implementation of the ZON editor
   - Follows vaxis patterns from text_input.zig and table.zig examples

2. **examples/sample.zon** (21 lines)
   - Sample .zon file for testing the editor
   - Contains typical .zon structure with dependencies

3. **examples/ZON_EDITOR_README.md** (55 lines)
   - Documentation for using the zon_editor
   - Lists all keybindings and features

### Modified Files
1. **build.zig**
   - Added `zon_editor` to the Example enum to enable building the example

## Features Implemented

### Display Grid
- ✅ Parses .zon files line by line
- ✅ Displays key-value pairs in a structured format
- ✅ Shows object tree structure with proper indentation levels
- ✅ Highlights selected row for easy navigation
- ✅ Implements scrolling for large files

### Navigation
- ✅ Vi-like keybindings (j/k for up/down)
- ✅ Arrow key support
- ✅ Jump to top (g) and bottom (G)
- ✅ Smart scrolling that follows selection

### Editing
- ✅ Edit mode for modifying values
- ✅ Shows current value when editing
- ✅ Clear visual feedback in edit mode
- ✅ Tracks modification status

### File Operations
- ✅ Loads .zon files from command line or defaults to build.zig.zon
- ✅ Saves changes with automatic backup creation (.bak extension)
- ✅ Warns before quitting with unsaved changes

### UI/UX
- ✅ Mode indicator (NORMAL/EDIT/COMMAND)
- ✅ Status bar with helpful messages
- ✅ Row counter (current/total)
- ✅ Modified indicator in header
- ✅ Bordered windows for visual clarity
- ✅ Color-coded elements

## Architecture

### Main Components

1. **ZonEntry struct**
   - Stores individual lines from the .zon file
   - Tracks key, value, indentation level
   - Supports expandable structures (for future enhancement)

2. **ZonEditor struct**
   - Main state management
   - File loading and parsing
   - Entry collection and modification
   - Mode tracking

3. **Event Loop**
   - Standard vaxis event loop pattern
   - Key press handling per mode
   - Window resizing support

### Code Patterns Used
- Follows existing libvaxis examples (text_input, table)
- Proper memory management with defer statements
- Arena allocator for render loop allocations
- Error handling with catch and logging

## Usage

### Building
```bash
zig build example -Dexample=zon_editor
```

### Running
```bash
# With default file (build.zig.zon)
zig build example -Dexample=zon_editor

# With specific file
zig build example -Dexample=zon_editor -- path/to/file.zon

# With sample file
zig build example -Dexample=zon_editor -- examples/sample.zon
```

### Keybindings

**Normal Mode:**
- `j` / `↓` - Move down
- `k` / `↑` - Move up
- `g` - Jump to top
- `G` - Jump to bottom
- `e` - Enter edit mode
- `s` - Save file
- `q` - Quit (warns if modified)
- `Q` - Force quit
- `Ctrl+c` - Force quit
- `Ctrl+l` - Refresh screen

**Edit Mode:**
- Type to enter new value
- `Enter` - Save changes
- `Escape` - Cancel editing

## Technical Details

### Parsing Strategy
The parser uses a line-by-line approach that:
1. Reads entire file into memory
2. Splits by newlines
3. Calculates indentation level
4. Identifies key-value patterns
5. Stores as structured entries

### Display Strategy
- Entries are rendered in a scrollable view
- Indentation is preserved and visualized
- Selected row is highlighted
- Status information shown at bottom

### Edit Strategy
- Shows current value when entering edit mode
- Uses vaxis TextInput widget for input handling
- Updates entry value on confirmation
- Sets modified flag for save tracking

### Save Strategy
- Creates backup file (.bak) before saving
- Reconstructs file from entry structure
- Preserves indentation and formatting
- Clears modified flag on success

## Future Enhancements
Possible improvements for future iterations:
- Tree folding/expanding for nested structures
- Syntax highlighting
- Undo/redo functionality
- Search functionality
- Multi-line value editing
- Validation of .zon syntax
- Auto-completion
- Diff view for changes

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various .zon file structures
2. Verify backup creation works correctly
3. Test navigation with large files
4. Verify memory cleanup (no leaks)
5. Test edge cases (empty files, malformed .zon)
6. Test window resizing behavior

## Code Quality
- No unsafe pointer operations
- Proper error handling throughout
- Memory allocations properly tracked and freed
- Follows Zig best practices
- Consistent with libvaxis code style
